# Notes for AWS CodeDeploy

- Each EC2 Machine (or On Premise machine) must be running the CodeDeploy Agent
- The agent is continously polling AWS CodeDeploy for work to do
- CodeDeploy sends appspec.yml file
- Application is pulled from GitHub or S3
- EC2 will run the deployment instructions
- CodeDeploy Agent will report of success/failure of deployment on the instance

- EC2 instances are grouped by deployment group (dev | test | prod)
- Lots of flexibility to define any kind of deployments
- CodeDeploy can be chained into CodePipeline and use artifacts from there
- CodeDeploy can re-use existing setup tools, work with any application, autoscaling integration
- Note: Blue/ Green only works with EC2 instances (not on premise)
- Support for AWS Lambda, EC2/On-premise and ECS
- CodeDeploy doesn't provision resources.
