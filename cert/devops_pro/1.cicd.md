# Note for CI/CD

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- Push code often
- Get code build & test
- Tell developers results of build

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

- Ensure software can be released reliably whenever needed
- Ensure deployments happen often and are quick
  => Automatic Deployment

  > Tools

  - CodeDeploy
  - Jenkins CD
  - Spinnaker
    ...

## Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

> Delivery

It's suitable for Stage Environment - wait for approve by QA/QC

- Deploy often using automation
- May involve a manual step to "approve" a deployment
- The deployment itself is still automated and repeated!

> Deployment

It's suitable for Dev Environment
Every Pull Request merged into `Develop` Branch will be deployed to Dev Environment.

- Full automation, every code change is deployed all the way to environment.
- No manual intervention of approvals.

## AWS Technology Stack for CICD

> Code => Build => Test => Deploy => Provision

- Code (AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, BitBucket, ...)
- Build & Test (AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins CI, 3th party CI servers, ...)
- Deploy & Provision (AWS Beanstalk, EC2 Instances Fleet - CloudFormation, AWS CodeDeploy, Jenkins CD, ...)

> Orchestrate (AWS CodePipeline / AWS CodeStar)
