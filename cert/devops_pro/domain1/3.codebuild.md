# Notes for AWS CodeBuild

- Fully managed build service
- Alternative to other build tools such as Jenkins
- Continuous scaling (no servers to manage or provision - no build queue)
  => Internally It will create double containers and you will pay for the usage it takes to complete
- Pay for usage: the time it takes to complete the builds
- Leverages Docker under the hood for reproducible builds and it's ephemeral.
- Posibility to extend capabilities leveraging our own base Docker images.
- Secure: Integration with KMS for encryption of build artifacts, IAM for build permissions, and VPC for network security, CloudTrail for API calls logging.

## How It works

- It will launch docker containers for us provision them and then shut it down after we're done of building and testing our code.
- Pay for the build time we use.

### Phases

> submitted

> queued

> provisioning

> download_source

> install

- runtime-versions
- commands: setup commands, what could we install on this docker image

> pre_build

- commands: any type of setup we would need: config files, ...

> build

- commands: what we actually to do to build and/or test our application.

> post_build

- commands: push the artifact to somewhere so we can use it in 2 different stages of our pipeline.

> upload_artifacts

> finalizing

> completed

### Artifacts

What is kept after our build are done

> files

> name

> base-directory

> secondary-artifacts
