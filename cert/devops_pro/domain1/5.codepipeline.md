# Notes for AWS CodePipeline

- Continous Delivery
- Visual Workflow
- Source: GitHub, CodeCommit, S3
- Build: CodeBuild, Jenkins, ...
- Load Testing: 3rd party tools
- Deploy: CodeDeploy, Beanstalk, CloudFormation, ECS, Jenkins, ...
- Made of Stages:
  - Each stage can sequential actions and/or parallel actions
  - Stage Ex: Build | Test | Deploy | LoadTest
  - Manual Approval can be defined at any stage

## Technology Stack for CICD

            Orchestrate: CodePipeline

    (Code => Build => Test => Deploy => Provision)

- Code: GitHub, CodeCommit, ...
- Build | Test: CodeBuild, Jenkins CI, ...
- Deploy | Provision: Beanstalk, CodeDeploy, EC2 Fleet (CFN)

## Artifacts

Each pipeline stage can create artifacts.
Artifacts are passed stored in S3 & passed on the next stage.

    Code: Trigger => Source => Push Output Artifacts to S3

    Build: Pickup Artifacts from S3 => Build => Push Output Artifacts to S3

    Deploy: Pickup Artifacts from S3 => Deploy

## Jenkins Plugins

Jenkins => Manage Plugins => Filter "aws"

- Amazon EC2
- AWS CodeBuild (Allow to launch Slaves as CodeBuild in AWS and then terminate when done)
- Amazon Elastic Container Service | Amazon EC2 Container plugin with Autoscaling Capabilities (Allow to launch Slaves into ECS )
- AWS CodePipeline
- S3 Publisher | Artifacts Manager on S3 (allow Jenkins to keep artifacts on S3)
