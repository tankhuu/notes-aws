# Notes for CloudFormation (CFN)

## Parameters

Input for CFN Template
Prevent error happening in template by using types
Use !Ref to reference a paramter anywhere in the template

- Type
  - String
  - Number
  - CommaDelimitedList
  - List<Type>
  - AWS Parameter (to help catch invalid values - match against existings value in the AWS Account)

- Contraints
  - ConstraintsDescription (String)
  - Min/Max Length
  - Min/Max Value
  - Defaults
  - AllowedValues (array)
  - AllowedPattern (regexp)
  - NoEcho (Boolean) - for passing a secret

### Pseudo Parameters

AWS::AccountId
AWS::NotificationARNs
AWS::NoValue
AWS::Region
AWS::StackId
AWS::StackName

## Resources (Mandatory)

Prepresent different AWS Components that will be created and configured
Resources are declared and can reference each other.

> Resource Types Identifiers are of the form: AWS::aws-product-name::data-type-name

[All Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)

## Mapping

Fixed Variables within CFN Template
They're very handy to differentiate between

- different environments: (dev | prod)
- regions (AWS Regions)
- AMI Types
- Availability Zones
- AWS Account

To access Mapping use: `Fn::FindInMap` (return a named value from a specific key)
Or `!FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey]`
Ex: `ImageId: !FindInMap [RegionMap, !Ref "AWS::Region", "64" ]`

```
Mappings:
  Mapping01:
    Key01:
      Name: Value01
    Key02:
      Name: Value02
```

> Can use mapping to define the package of product for Athena in Karros

- small: BE(m5.large), CQ(t3.small), RDS(db.t3.small)
- medium: BE(m5.large), CQ(t3.medium), RDS(db.t3.medium)
- large: BE(m5.large), CQ(t3.large), RDS(db.t3.medium)
- xlarge: BE(m5.xlarge), CQ(t3.xlarge), RDS(db.m5.large)

```
Mappings:
  Package:
    Small:
      "BE": "m5.large"
      "CQ": "t3.small"
      "DB": "db.t3.small"
      "WN": "t3.large" # WOSNOS Instance Type
      "Debezium": ""
      "GeoServer": ""
    Medium:
      "BE": "m5.large"
      "CQ": "t3.small"
      "DB": "db.t3.small"
      "WN": "t3.large" # WOSNOS Instance Type
      "Debezium": ""
      "GeoServer": ""
    Large:
      "BE": "m5.large"
      "CQ": "t3.small"
      "DB": "db.t3.small"
      "WN": "t3.large" # WOSNOS Instance Type
      "Debezium": ""
      "GeoServer": ""

```

## Parameters vs Mappings

Mappings are great when you know in advance all the values that can be taken and that they can be deduced from variables (region, environment, AWS Account, ...). They allow safer controll over template

Parameters used when we don't know in the advance what User wants to specify.

## Outputs

- The Outputs section declares optional outputs values that we can import into other stacks (if you export them first)!
- It’s the best way to perform some collaboration cross stack, as you let expert handle their own part of the stack
- You can’t delete a CloudFormation Stack if its outputs are being referenced by another CloudFormation stack

## Conditions

- Conditions are used to control the creation of resources or outputs based on a condition.
- Conditions can be whatever you want them to be, but common ones are:
  - Environment (dev / test / prod)
  - AWS Region
  - Any parameter value
- Each condition can reference another condition, parameter value or mapping

The intrinsic function (logical) can be any of the following:
- Fn::And
- Fn::Equals
- Fn::If
- Fn::Not
- Fn::Or

## Must Know Intrisic Functions

- Fn::Ref (!Ref)
  - Parameters => returns the value of the parameter
  - Resources => returns the physical ID of the underlying resource (ex: EC2 ID)
- Fn::GetAtt (!GetAtt)
- Fn::FindInMap - `!FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]`
- Fn::ImportValue
- Fn::Join - `!Join [ delimiter, [ comma-delimited list of values ] ]`
- Fn::Sub (!Sub) (Substitute)
  ```
    !Sub
      - String
      - { Var1Name: Var1Value, Var2Name: Var2Value }
  ```
- Condition Functions (Fn::If, Fn::Not, Fn::Equals, etc...)

## DependsOn

Depends on is a way to say that this resource should not be created until the other resource has been created.

## User Data

- The important thing to pass is the entire script through the function Fn::Base64 
- User data script log is in `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`

```
  UserData:
    Fn::Base64: |
      #!/bin/bash -xe
      yum update -y
      yum install -y httpd
      systemctl start httpd
      systemctl enable httpd
```

## cfn-init

- AWS::CloudFormation::Init must be in the Metadata of a resource
- With the cfn-init script, it helps make complex EC2 configurations readable
- Logs go to `/var/log/cfn-init.log`

```
  UserData:
    Fn::Base64: |
      #!/bin/bash -xe
      # Get the latest CloudFormation package
      yum install -y aws-cfn-bootstrap
      # Start cfn-int
      /opt/aws/bin/cfn-init -s ${AWS::StackId} -r MyInstance --region ${AWS::Region} || error_exit 'Failed to run cfn-init'
Metadata:
  Comment: Install a simple apache package
  AWS::CloudFormation::Init:
    config:
      packages:
        yum:
          httpd: []
      files:
        "/var/www/html/index.html":
          content: |
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
          mode: '000644'
      commands:
        hello:
          command: "echo 'hello'"
      services:
        sysvinit:
          httpd:
            enabled: 'true'
            ensureRunning: 'true'
```

## cfn-signal & wait conditions

- We can use the cfn-signal script to tell CloudFormation that the EC2 instance got properly configured after a cfn-init
- Tell CloudFormation service to keep on going or fail
- We need to define WaitCondition
  - Block the template until it receives a signal from cfn-signal
  - We attach a CreationPolicy (also works on EC2, ASG)

Wait Condition Didn't Receive the Required Number of Signals from an Amazon EC2 Instance
- Ensure that the AMI you're using has the AWS CloudFormation helper scripts installed. If the AMI doesn't include the helper scripts, you can also download them to your instance.
- Verify that the cfn-init & cfn-signal command was successfully run on the instance. You can view logs, such as /var/log/cloud-init.log or /var/log/cfn-init.log, to help you debug the instance launch.
- You can retrieve the logs by logging in to your instance, but you must disable rollback on failure or else AWS CloudFormation deletes the instance after your stack fails to create.
- Verify that the instance has a connection to the Internet. If the instance is in a VPC, the instance should be able to connect to the Internet through a NAT device if it's is in a private subnet or through an Internet gateway if it's in a public subnet.
- For example, run: curl -I https://aws.amazon.com  

## Retaining Data on Deletes

You can put a DeletionPolicy on any resource to control what happens when the CloudFormation template is deleted
- DeletionPolicy=Retain:
  - Specify on resources to preserve / backup in case of CloudFormation deletes
  - To keep a resource, specify Retain (works for any resource / nested stack)
- DeletionPolicy=Snapshot:
  - EBS Volume, ElastiCache Cluster, ElastiCache ReplicationGroup
  - RDS DBInstance, RDS DBCluster, Redshift Cluster
- DeletePolicy=Delete (default behavior):
  - Note: for AWS::RDS::DBCluster resources, the default policy is Snapshot
  - Note: to delete an S3 bucket, you need to first empty the bucket of its content

## CloudFormation Custom Resources (Lambda)  

You can define a Custom Resource in CloudFormation to address any of these use cases:
- An AWS resource is yet not covered (new service for example)
- An On-Premise resource
- Emptying an S3 bucket before being deleted
- Fetch an AMI id
- Anything you want...!

The Lambda Function will get invoked only if there is a Create, Update or Delete event, not every time you run the template

## InsufficientCapabilitiesExeption

If we receive this error message: `InsufficientCapabilitiesExeption` that means we didn't provide the CFN Stack the capability that it needs to work

- CAPABILITY_IAM & CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM: need to provide our CFN Stack the capability to provide the IAM Resources
-
