# Elastic BeanStalk

## Save Configuration

`eb config save dev-env --cfg initial-configuration`

## Deployment

- All at once: fastest, downtime -> suit for development environment
- Rolling: update a few instances at a time (bucket), and then move onto the next bucket once the first bucket is healthy -> application is running below capacity, version simultaneously, long deployment
- Rolling with additional batches: like rolling, but spins up new instances to move the batch (so that the old application is still available) -> app running in capacity, versions simultaneously, longer deployment, good for prod environment.
- Immutable: spins up new instances in a new ASG, deploys version to these instances, and then swaps all the instances when everything is healthy -> zero downtime, high cost, double capacity, quick rollback, great for prod environment.
