# Elastic BeanStalk

## Save Configuration

`eb config save dev-env --cfg initial-configuration`

## Deployment

- All at once: fastest, downtime -> suit for development environment
- Rolling: update a few instances at a time (bucket), and then move onto the next bucket once the first bucket is healthy -> application is running below capacity, version simultaneously, long deployment
- Rolling with additional batches: like rolling, but spins up new instances to move the batch (so that the old application is still available) -> app running in capacity, versions simultaneously, longer deployment, good for prod environment.
- Immutable: spins up new instances in a new ASG, deploys version to these instances, and then swaps all the instances when everything is healthy -> zero downtime, high cost, double capacity, quick rollback, great for prod environment.

## Blue/Green Deployment


## Save configuration

This feature will help to create a configuration for EB in a file `prod.cfg.yml`, we can store this file in Git or somewhere and apply it in any where that we want.
Let's say that we wan to deploy the same EB environments in another region, then all we need to do is just go to EB in that region, load this configuration file and create the new env from there.

Configuration files will be store under folder `.elasticbeanstalk/.saved_configs`

### Commands

`eb config save dev-env --cfg initial-configuration` # Generate initial-configuration.cfg.yml file

`eb setenv ENABLE_COOL_NEW_FEATURE=true` # Add environment variables into config

`eb config put prod` # Update/Add new configuration in EB

## [EB Extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions-optionsettings.html)

All files will be stored under folder `.ebextensions`

```
option_settings:
- namespace: namespace
  option_name: option name
  value: option value
```

### option_settings

aws:autoscaling:asg:
  max:
  min:
  desired:
aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration:
  InstanceType: 

### .ebextensions for Resources

Using Resources block
- Add DynamoDB
- Add RDS

```
Resources:
  DynamoDBTable:
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties:
      ...
  NotificationTopic:
    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic

Outputs:
  NotificationTopicArn:
    Description:
    Value:

option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    # these are assigned dynamically during a deployment
    NOTIFICATION_TOPIC: '`{"Ref": "NotificationTopic"}`'
    DYNAMODB_TABLE: '`{"Ref": "DynamoDBTable"}`'
    AWS_REGION: '`{"Ref": "AWS::Region"}`'
```

Then run `eb deploy` to apply new changes

For getting the environment variables
```
# SSH into the instance and run
/opt/elasticbeanstalk/bin/get-config environment | jq
/opt/elasticbeanstalk/bin/get-config environment -k NOTIFICATION_TOPIC
/opt/elasticbeanstalk/bin/get-config environment -k DYNAMODB_TABLE
/opt/elasticbeanstalk/bin/get-config optionsettings
```

## Precedence

- Settings applied directly to the environment
- Saved Configurations
- Configuration Files (.ebextensions)
- Default Values

## RDS In or Out of Environment

- Create RDS or DynamoDB Table in separate stack
- Add the environment variables into Elastic Beanstalk Configuration
- This will help to keep Data when Elastic Beanstalk Environment is deleted, unless all the resources defined in `.ebextension` or `.elasticbeanstalk` will be deleted aswell

## EB Commands VS Container Commands

- [Commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html#linux-commands) used to execute commands on EC2 instance, the commands run before the application and web server are setup and the application version file is extracted
- [Container Commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html#linux-container-commands) used to execute commands that effect your application source code. Container commands run after the application and web server have been setup and the application version archive has been extracted, but before the application version is deployed.
  - Can be used to run DB Migration with the combination of option `leader_only: true` which will specify that we only run this command on a single instance

## Deployment Modes

- _All at once_ (deploy all in one go): fastest but instance aren't able to serve the traffic for a bit (downtime)
- _Rolling_: update a few instance at a time (bucket), and then move onto the next bucket once the first bucket is healthy.
- _Rolling with additional batches_: like rolling, but spins up new instances to move the patch (so that the old application is still available)
- _Immutable_: spins up new instances in a new ASG, deploys version to these instances, and then swaps  all the instances when everything is healthy

> Blue/Green Not a direct feature of EB, zero downtime, and release facility by 

- Creating a new stage environment and deploy v2 there (Green)
- The new env (green) can be validated indepently and roll back if issues
- Route53 can be setup using weighted policies to redirect a little bit of traffic to the stage environment
- Use EB swap URLs when done with the green env
