# AWS SSM Automation

[Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html)

Systems Manager Automation simplifies common maintenance and deployment tasks of EC2 instances and other AWS resources. Automation enables you to do the following:

- Build Automation workflows to configure and manage instances and AWS resources.
- Create custom workflows or use pre-defined workflows maintained by AWS.
- Receive notifications about Automation tasks and workflows by using Amazon EventBridge.
- Monitor Automation progress and execution details by using the Amazon EC2 or the AWS Systems Manager console.
